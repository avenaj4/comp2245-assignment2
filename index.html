        <h2>Designing With Intention: My UI Workflow</h2>
        <p class="meta">October 1st, 2025 by Avena Joseph</p>

        <p>
          Whenever I start working on a new design, I always grab a notebook first.
          I like scribbling messy sketches before touching any software it helps me
          figure out what I actually want to build. Once I see the ideas on paper,
          I move into simple wireframes on the computer. That way I can test the
          flow and layout before worrying about colors and fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, I focus on making everything feel consistent. I play with
          spacing, colors, and typography until the design feels balanced. I try to
          keep accessibility in mind too like checking contrast and making sure text
          is easy to read. By the time I add the final polish, the design already
          feels functional and smooth.

        <h2>From Idea to Deployment: Shipping My First React App</h2>
        <p class="meta">September 15, 2025 by Avena Joseph</p>

        <p>
          I finally built and launched my first React app this month! It’s a simple
          tracker that helps me log study sessions and see how much time I spend on
          each subject. At first, I was nervous about breaking things, but keeping
          the app small really helped me focus. I started with just the basics
          adding, editing, and viewing sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most exciting part was putting it online. I set up a basic workflow
          that builds and tests my code whenever I push changes, and then it
          automatically deploys. Seeing my app live on the web felt amazing.
          It’s definitely not perfect, but I learned a lot about React, Git, and
          deployment along the way.
